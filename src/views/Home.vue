            I became interested in photography several years ago after seeing the big cameras and lenses at my sister's softball tournaments.
            My parents ended up purchasing me my first DSLR camera - a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi with an 18-55mm and 75-300mm lens.
            I took well over 20,000 photos with that camera and it went practically everywhere.

            After purchasing my Nissan 370z, I wanted to get better quality photos of it than I could take with just my cell phone.
            Upon researching the cameras on the market, I decided on a Canon EOS Rebel T5i with an 18-55mm lens.
            I later purchased a 50mm macro lens to use with it as well.
            Again, I took over 20,000 photos with it. Many of those photos were taken at various car shows and  cruise nights that I
            participated in.

            In search of better quality and more fine-grained control, I recently purchased my first full-frame DSLR camera -
            a Canon EOS 6D Mark II with the 24-105mm f/4L II lens and Canon battery grip.
            In the first year of ownership, I have already taken several thousand photos with it and look forward to taking thousands more!
